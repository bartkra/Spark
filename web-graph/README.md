# Spark
Project in Apache Spark (in scala) using map-reduce model to calculate in- and out-degrees in directed graph, and clustering coefficients in undirected graph. To calculate the latter NodeIterator++ algorithm was used.

Data for the graph was taken from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Stanford.html).
